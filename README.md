***DESIGN PATTERN AND PROGRAMMING PARADIGM***

    1. Design Pattern - the Python file have a corresponding Jupyter Notebook file and Python files, the files has been
                        divided into separate c++ modules.
    
    2. Software Paradigm - a Functional programming paradigm has been adopted
    
    3. Work in progress 
    
***C CODE MODULES***

      1. This code files merely demonstrate the ability to use programming langauges to write programs and algorithms construction;
         They are not unit-tested nor written according according to software best practices.

      2. Alternative C++ code modules for models all written in Python and Jupyter Notebook
